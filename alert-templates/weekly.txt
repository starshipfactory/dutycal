Dear co-members,

The following opening hours during the next few weeks have not been assigned
yet:

{{ range . }} * {{.Title}}
   on {{.Start}} for {{.Duration}}
{{ if .Reference }}   (See {{.Reference}} for details){{ end }}
   Please sign up on https://dutycal.example.org/event/{{.Id|urlquery}}/view

{{ end }}Please sign up for these if you have time, so we can guarantee that
our space will be open. It is easier if you sign up early so that we can
spread this responsibility across as many sholders as possible.

Thanks a lot,
your faithful duty calendar
